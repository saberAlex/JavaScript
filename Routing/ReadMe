to handle one single page to 'fake' it like having other pages we can use ng-route. 
First we need to put to the script and add the dependency to the module:

        <script src="//code.angularjs.org/1.3.0-rc.1/angular-route.min.js"></script>
		in App.js
		var myApp = angular.module('myApp', ['ngRoute']);

Next we need to configure the route: 
myApp.config(function ($routeProvider) {
	............
	...........
	........

and then to actually put the template in the index html
we use another ng-view, example:
	            <div ng-view></div>

So all the template that come from the routing (myApp.config) will be place there..
The major improvement is with this we don't need to reload our page. 
We just need to seemlessly load our template. NEAT

Now What if I want to give it a value. 
I can put something like this, example:
	'/weapon/:power'
and I will get the value... from my controller
there is also another router out there... 
Why this is so popular?
	First I can do lots of thing...
	and this is really fast, Imagine, if I'm going to the second page I will need to download all over again.
